# GitHub Secrets Sync Configuration
#
# This configuration defines which secrets to sync from which source repository
# to which target repositories.
#
# IMPORTANT: This uses a whitelist approach - only secrets listed here will be synced.
# Secret values must be available as environment variables when the workflow runs.

# Source repository (auto-detected from git or GitHub Actions if omitted)
# source_repository: my-org/source-repo

# List of secret names to sync (default for all targets)
# Each target can override this with its own subset
secrets:
  - API_TOKEN
  - DATABASE_URL
  - APP_SECRET_KEY

# Target repositories to sync secrets to
# Each target can specify its own subset of secrets, or omit to get all secrets
targets:
  # This target gets all secrets from the global list
  - repository: my-org/target-repo-1

  # This target only gets specific secrets (per-target override)
  - repository: my-org/target-repo-2
    secrets:
      - API_TOKEN
      - DATABASE_URL

  # Another example with custom subset
  - repository: my-org/monitoring
    secrets:
      - API_TOKEN
      - MONITORING_KEY
